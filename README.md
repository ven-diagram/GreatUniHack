"# GreatUniHack" 

For this challenge, we've decided to do some social good by creating a non-profit web app.

- This game allows users to log in every day and choose a charity of their choice to support.
- They then proceed to watch an ad, most likely offered by Google adSense.
- Then they are invited to take part in a picture guessing game, where-in which you must guess what the picture is depicting in a certain amount of guesses; with each guess making the picture slightly less blurry and easier to make out.
- Those who complete the daily task in the least amount of time will have all the adSense revenue pooled and diveded amongst the charities that they chose.
- There will also be an option to donate more upfront via our game or thorugh the charities official donation scheme.
